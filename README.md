I am giving you a very innovative project of my own. The  best part is that I am giving  you guys a design mockup of the app.
The project: Incubator Club
Idea: This web app provides a workflow for innovations and its incubation. Employee or students submit  their project ideas witha  working  prototype(github link) and others like product managers, professors, sales people rate teh idea and approve them. Once approved innovator work on the idea until it incubates and becomes part of the product portfolio. 

If successfully done, I want to use this in my 272 class for approving projects from next semester.

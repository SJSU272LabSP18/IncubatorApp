<h3>Project title: Chatbot weather<br></h3>
Project description: A chatbot where user can query weather base on location/zipcode and chatbot will give the temperature as well as recommendation for the next two weeks.  
<br>Proposed methodology/resources:
MongoDB for storing data, Spark for processing data, Hadoop for storing data and Yahoo API for weather.

<h3>Project title: Lucy for Seniors</h3>
<p>Project description: #1 problems our seniors (over 80) face today is loneliness and isolation. According to the U.S. Census Bureau 11 million, or 28% of people aged 65 and older, lived alone at the time of the census. As people get older, their likelihood of living alone only increases. Additionally, more and more older adults do not have children, reports the AARP, and that means fewer family members to provide company and care as those adults become seniors.</p>
<ol><li>Senior isolation increases the risk of mortality.</li>
  <li>Feelings of loneliness can negatively affect both physical and mental health.</li>
  <li>Perceived loneliness contributes to cognitive decline and risk of dementia.</li>
  <li>Social isolation makes seniors more vulnerable to elder abuse.</li>
  <li>Loneliness in seniors is a major risk factor for depression.</li>
  </ol>
<p>Lucy is an effort to use technology and a  group of student volunteers to solve the problem  of social isolation of seniors. Lucy is a skill developed for Amazon Alexa device echo dot which sits in seniorâ€™s room. A group of student volunteers write personal emails to our seniors . Lucy reads those emails from a server to seniors as they come or at certain time. If seniors can share stories and Lucy collects them that would be great.</p>
Proposed methodology/resources:<br>
We would need to setup a connection to AWS and Alexa. Most likely we would use Javascript or Python to create the project and we would have to use google API to get emails from an account.

<h3>Project title: Microlending solution for remote areas using blockchain.</h3>
Project Description: In many parts of the world where poverty is a common issue. Microlending becomes one possible solution for the people to start producing beyond their own means. Microlending allows people with no colateral to have access to credit. That makes them fight their way out of poverty and have more financial inclusion. For remote areas with no access to institutions and the use of cell phones being prevalent around the world even on many of those remote locations. a blockchain solution can help people keep track of the loans they were given as well as have electronic transactions in places where even legal tender is hard to access.
<br>We would use using IBM Blockchain solution to test how this system would operate and scale to the level of small communities.

<h3>Project title: Forager Map</h3>
<p>Project description: Need a few sprigs of rosemary for your recipe? It doesn't get more local than just around the corner. Forager allows users to locate food plants growing in their area, fostering a sense of connection to their urban environment. Users can seach from thousands of plants pulled from a San Francisco plant census, and search by criteria such as harvest season. Users can mark plant locations they've found on the map so others can find good spots for foraging. Project can be expanded from SF to the Bay Area.</p>
Proposed methodology/resources:<br>
<ul>
  <li>[SQLite] - Database contains thousands of plants, users, and plant reviews</li>
  <li>[SQLAlchemy] - Streamlines database queries </li>
<li>[Python] - Backend code that manipulates incoming data, controls access to the database, and serves data to the webpage through a framework.</li>
<li>[Flask] - Lightweight web framework which also provides support for jinja templating and unittests</li>
  <li>[Javascript] - Frontend code which allows for dynamic webpages</li>
<li>[jQuery] - A Javascript library that simplifies DOM manipulation, including creating event handlers for user interaction</li>
<li>[AJAX] - Gets information from server without reloading the page, allowing for more dynamic pages and faster loading times</li>
<li>[Leaflet/Mapbox API] - Uses geoJSON passed from the server to create dynamic plant maps, and reverse geocoding to translate coordinates to the nearest addresses.</li>
  <li>[HTML] - Displays information on the web</li>
  <li>[CSS] - Styles webpages</li>
  <li>[Twitter Bootstrap] - Frontend UI framework for quick styling</li>
